# Custom select

This project is just a PoC and I made it for learning purposes. I wanted to try out 
  * how could I implement a base select form element with Angular Material
  * how to implement the _ControlValueAccessor_ interface
  * how to inherit a more specialized form element from that base control
  * how to grant the two-way dataflow between the form and the custom elements

In the project I implemented a basic select form control as I mentioned above, and two child form control. I used these two in a _FormArray_.
